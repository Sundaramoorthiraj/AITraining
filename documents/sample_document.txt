Local RAG System Documentation

Overview
The Local RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) System is a comprehensive solution for document question-and-answering using open-source large language models running on CPU. This system enables organizations to maintain data privacy while leveraging the power of modern AI for document analysis.

Key Features
- Document Processing: Supports PDF, DOCX, DOC, XLSX, XLS, and TXT files
- Vector Embeddings: Uses Sentence Transformers for semantic search
- Vector Storage: FAISS-based efficient similarity search
- Local LLM: Quantized models for CPU inference
- Privacy-First: All processing happens locally

Architecture Components

1. Document Processor
The document processor handles text extraction from various file formats. It splits documents into manageable chunks with configurable overlap to maintain context continuity.

2. Embedding Generator
Uses the all-MiniLM-L6-v2 model from Sentence Transformers to generate vector representations of text chunks. These embeddings capture semantic meaning for similarity search.

3. Vector Store
FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) provides efficient indexing and retrieval of vector embeddings. It supports cosine similarity search for finding relevant document chunks.

4. LLM Inference
Local language model inference using quantized models optimized for CPU execution. The system supports various open-source models including Llama 2 variants.

Performance Considerations
- CPU-only inference reduces hardware costs
- Quantized models minimize memory requirements
- Vector indexing enables fast similarity search
- Chunking strategy balances context and performance

Use Cases
- Internal document search and analysis
- Compliance and regulatory document review
- Knowledge base question answering
- Research document summarization
- Technical documentation assistance

Installation Requirements
- Python 3.8 or higher
- 8GB+ RAM recommended
